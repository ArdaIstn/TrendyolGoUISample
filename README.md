# TrendyolGoUISample

I created this project to reinforce the concepts I learned during the Kekod training. 
This project is part of the Kekod training program and covers topics related to the Navigation Component and Bottom Navigation. 
**TrendyolGoUISample** is a sample Android project inspired by the UI design of the Trendyol Go app. 


## Structured Used

- **Modern Navigation**: Utilizes the Android Navigation Component for smooth and intuitive screen transitions, ensuring a cohesive user experience across different sections of the app.
- **Bottom Navigation**: Implements a customizable `BottomNavigationView` that provides users with easy access to the main sections of the app, enhancing usability and quick navigation.
- **RecyclerView**: Efficiently handles and displays large sets of data in a list format, supporting multiple view types and improving performance with built-in view recycling.
- **CardView**: Presents information in a visually appealing card-like format, adding elevation and rounded corners to create a consistent and polished UI design.
- **XML Layouts**: Defines the app's user interface using XML files, allowing for a clear separation of UI design from business logic and making it easier to maintain and update layouts.
- **ViewBinding**: Simplifies the process of accessing UI elements by generating binding classes for each XML layout, reducing the risk of `NullPointerException` and improving code readability.
